# Raw data

Our dataset comes from a study examining the early host response to immunodeficiency virus infection using an SIV infection in rhesus monkey model. Female outbred, Indian-origin macaca mulatta were vaginally infected with the SIVmac251 strain. Samples were obtained from 34 monkeys from 28 different tissues (8-25 samples per monkey), resulting in 697 samples that were analyzed by microarray. Four monkeys were sacrificed at day 0 (uninfected control) and the remaining animals were necropsied at day 1 (4 subjects), day 3 (9 subjects), day 7 (13 subjects) or day 10 (4 subjects). This allows analysis of tissue-specific temporal gene expression changes in the first ten days of SIV infection.

The data was analyzed and [published](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286741630277X) in Cell on April 2016 and the corresponding dataset is publicly available on Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession number [GSE80013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE8). The file is too large to upload into the GitHub group repository but we provide a [sample overview](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_SIV-in-Rhesus-Monkeys/blob/master/Data/Raw%20Data/SIV-sample-overview.xlsx) detailing the number and types of tissue samples collected for each monkey, organized by day post infection. As mentioned above, 697 samples were analyzed (=697 columns). For each samples, 47,232 probes were quantified (=47,232 rows), corresponding to over 30,000 genes. The samples were run on Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip, quantified by Illumina iScan System and the data was collected using Illumina GenomeStudio software. In the corresponding publication, tissue samples were grouped into four categories (blood, female reproductive tract, gastrointestinal tract and lymph nodes). All microarray analysis was performed using these four categories.
